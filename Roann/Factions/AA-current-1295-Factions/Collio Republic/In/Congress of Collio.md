Formerly just Collio, it is the de-facto capital city of the [[Collio Republic]], as all other cities meet here to discuss the future of the republic ([[The history of the Skigness peninsula|The foundation of the Collio Republic]]), which lies next to the [[Cliyne College]]. It prides itself on being both scientifically and philosophically advanced.
## Ideas
- Center of research, education and philosophy (This is magic Greece, after all)(btw what's the state of technology in this world? Just classic D&D shit?)
	- 14th-15th century on classical stuff, but in some regards more advanced then that (Witcher, Hobbit, ...). (DnD baby)
- Since Collio is a republic this is where the parliament sits (Or president, whichever type of republic Collio is)
	- The main idea behind it (the whole Collio thing), is that some guy (Collio) who was/is influential ruled idk few cities (tldr already some kind of noble), then because the business was mainly aimed at safe, but lawful trading (with the "police" being quite strong), the attention grew more and more from Iremorth Kingdm. and Kaspion Emp., who basically just said fuck it, for this sum of money u can manage this land under xx rules. (Could be something of a save haven) ->>> plot thickens and shit
	- U can change it idk, this was the first idea behind it.
	- + A side note, I don't think I want to split the world into it's own good side and bad side. The military here is more of a protection from the wild. Like yes, there is gonna be shit ton of "evil organizations", but not like a 35% of map is bad and war is ongoing (!!in this era!!). (But some areas are gonna be hostile (more specifically in Gunlags DoDO, because of the whole nature of the continent + some special areas like [[The Majestic Jungle]], which will have "dangerous" tribe there (Some plot with GDoDO and jungle shit).).)
		- This doesn't mean that some civil war could brake out ehm ehm (Ardess MR foreshadowing....)
