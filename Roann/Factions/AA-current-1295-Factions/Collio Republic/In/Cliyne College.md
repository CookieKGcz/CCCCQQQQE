Just a question, there's an unmarked city next to it on the map, what's that?

But u can change it if u want ^^

Ohhhh, I thought CoC (I hate that abbreviation { :> })  was on The Great Lake, it would make sense for the College to be right next to the capital

Well, I've got to rewrite the entirety of CoC now
