## Quick Info
- Located in the Hearth of [[Kaspion Empire]]. 
- Surrounded by the biggest mountain range in Roann, it is not easy to get there. 
- Majority of the population are Dwarfs.
- On top diameter is around 90 km (15px).
- Depth is unknown, because of the 13th layer.
## The Hole
For probably 3000 years it has been called for the local folk just the hole. XXX

## Layers
The whole depth is so outstanding that after going deeper and deeper the miners, researchers and other insane people that go there created sections for it.
- ### 1st layer
	- Stretching the first 60 km under. The first kilometer has even pubs and houses as only flying creatures are living here. Most of the walls are from stone and minerals are rarely discovered.
	- This part is quite calm. The [[Dwelling-Delving gears]] will make the job relatively easy.
	- Cr(2-4)
	- Safehouses - a lot
- ### 2nd layer
	- About the same as the 1st but less light, more creatures, more slippery, less known tracks and overall just more difficult
	- The [[Sun Lupines]] are present, which its lianas are more thicker and more in quantity deeper you go.
	- + ~70 km of depth
	- Cr(3-5)
	- Safehouses - 231
- ### 3rd layer
	- 3rd layer has 2 parts. The first is the whole abyss narrowing to just about 29 km and then the second where is goes down almost 90 degrees.
	- A document of approval from the [[Buraeu of Central Kaspion]].
	- + ~14+108 km of depth (total to the 3rd 252km)
	- Cr(5-8)
	- Safehouses - 57 + 6 official buildings for checking.
- ### 4th layer
	- Entrance: This point is the limit for normal people. The Hole might have some abundance of mana, which helps with the pressure, but not this much. 
	- The only source of light are natural mana crystals and some flowers.
	- For the type of vegetation, it is similar to a jungle. Trees, vines, and a lot of creatures that are going to be hostile if enraged.
	- For the lower stages - Beware of the mud. It is deep.
	- Somewhere between 85 km of depth.
	- Cr(5-9)
	- Safehouses - 43
- ### 5th layer
	- This is the first part of the "twist". You are practically going between 30 to 60 degrees down the whole time. Also the whole time you are checking the walls and ceiling (where you pretty much see nothing) for things that could kill you.
	- From this point on it is recommended to bring a party and be efficient and experienced with killing creatures.
	- Also the ceiling being covered with vines which are also hanging from it doesn't really help.
	- Cr(6-10)
	- Safehouses - 28
- ### 6th layer
	- Now halfway through the twist the atmosphere changes. From Jungle you are going to crystalline cave.
	- Crazy sharp crystalline cave to be exact. So be worry of the environment itself, because if you fall just a few meters there is almost guaranteed chance that you are going to be impaled, sliced open or minimally in the need of a healer.
	- Cr(8-11)
	- Safehouses - 7 + 5 before the entrance to the 7th layer
- ### 7th layer
	- XX
	- Obsidian, kilometers long tubes in a complex web.
	- [[Night gear]] is a must, as there is not a single shred of light present.
	- This floor is also known for the multiple false entrances, and the "skip", which is basically skipping the 8th layer through a single tunnel.
	- Cr(9-13)
	- ![[829be2499f140af1db458fcff2938f21.jpg]] but a lot more dark and gargantuan 
- ### 8th layer
	- A tricky/easy, but long. (slow, because of not making a sound. Silance spell is a must)
	- X
	- X
	- X
- ### 9th layer
	- sand
- ### 10th layer
	- pillars 
- ### 11th layer
	- worm tracks
- ### 12th layer
	- hot?
- ### 13th layer
	- Those who returned to tell the tail are less then 100. There are only 87 documented returnee for the last 2000 years.
	- Those who then documented their findings said that there is only void or bottomless abyss out there. Most probably filled with horrors too.
- ### 14th layer
	- ???
	-
