Formerly just Collio, it is the de-facto capital city of the [[Collio Republic]], as all other cities meet here to discuss the future of the republic ([[The history of the Skigness peninsula|The foundation of the Collio Republic]]), which lies next to the [[Cliyne College]]. It prides itself on being both scientifically and philosophically advanced.
## Ideas
- Center of research, education and philosophy (This is magic Greece, after all)(btw what's the state of technology in this world? Just classic D&D shit?)
	- 14th-15th century on classical stuff, but in some regards more advanced then that (Witcher, Hobbit, ...). (DnD baby)
- Since Collio is a republic this is where the parliament sits (Or president, whichever type of republic Collio is)
	- The main idea behind it (the whole Collio thing), is that some guy (Collio) who was/is influential ruled idk few cities (tldr already some kind of noble), then because the business was mainly aimed at safe, but lawful trading (with the "police" being quite strong), the attention grew more and more from Iremorth Kingdm. and Kaspion Emp., who basically just said fuck it, for this sum of money u can manage this land under xx rules. (Could be something of a save haven) ->>> plot thickens and shit
		- (Deadass that's just Hong Kong)
		- Okay, I've got two very stupid ideas
			 1. Collio is the ruler in [[Congress of Collio|the city of Colio]] and writes [[The history of the Skigness peninsula|On the future of the Skigness peninsula]], and after his death everybody just decides that uniting is a great idea. Problem being: What were the cities doing before uniting? Which can have a few explanations like
				 1. They were just independent city-states, and for some reason never got invaded (if the trade on The Great Lake is extra rich) 
				 2. Collio was just such a good diplomat and managed to strike peace with both Empires
				 3. They got lucky and no one wanted to attack them
				 
				 4. They're a vassal of both of them 
			2.  Collio was a prominent merchant in [[Skigness]] and wrote [[The history of the Skigness peninsula|On the future of the Skigness peninsula]]. Then, he just bought his way into power and paid every other city-state. Would emphasize how rich trade on The Great Lake is, but I'm not sure having someone who's so rich he can just make a country would be good
	- U can change it idk, this was the first idea behind it.
	- + A side note, I don't think I want to split the world into it's own good side and bad side. The military here is more of a protection from the wild. Like yes, there is gonna be shit ton of "evil organizations", but not like a 35% of map is bad and war is ongoing (!!in this era!!). (But some areas are gonna be hostile (more specifically in Gunlags DoDO, because of the whole nature of the continent + some special areas like [[The Majestic Jungle]], which will have "dangerous" tribe there (Some plot with GDoDO and jungle shit).).)
		- This doesn't mean that some civil war could brake out ehm ehm (Ardess MR foreshadowing....)
