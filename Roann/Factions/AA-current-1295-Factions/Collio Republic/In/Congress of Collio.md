The capital city of the [[Collio Republic]] which lies on [[Skigness Bay]] in [[The Great Lake]] 
(I suppose this is the capital city, right?)
## Ideas
- Center of all trade in The Great Lake (Effect: Lots of shops, could act as a major location where you could take a ferry to other cities on The Great Lake)
- Center of research, education and philosophy (This is magic Greece, after all)(btw what's the state of technology in this world? Just classic D&D shit?)
- Since Collio is a republic this is where the parliament sits (Or president, whichever type of republic Collio is)
