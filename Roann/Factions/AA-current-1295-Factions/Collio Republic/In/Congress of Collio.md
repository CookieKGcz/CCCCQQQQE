Formerly just Collio, it is the de-facto capital city of the [[Collio Republic]], as all other cities meet here to discuss the future of the republic ([[The history of the Skigness peninsula|The foundation of the Collio Republic]]), which lies next to the [[Cliyne College]]. It prides itself on being both scientifically and philosophically advanced.
## Ideas
- Center of research, education and philosophy (This is magic Greece, after all)(btw what's the state of technology in this world? Just classic D&D shit?)
- Since Collio is a republic this is where the parliament sits (Or president, whichever type of republic Collio is)
