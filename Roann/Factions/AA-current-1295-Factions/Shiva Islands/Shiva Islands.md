## Consist of: 
- [[The tower of Rekku]]

## Geography
The surrounding isles are populated to the minimum, because of the raging [[Thisos sea]] and really the main core is the main Island. The norther part and the shores are more or less for the commoners (and spoiler: for the humans). All you can pretty much find are normal villages or some bigger towns (like 5000 to 10000 population). Then, undoubtedly, you will run into the [[Shiva peaks]], which are for most commoners dangerous and is probably the first thing you will be warned about in every village. 
If you were to cross them you would probably feel very weird and have feeling that something or someone is looking at you. And you would without question be right :). Right after the peaks, there is a [[Dim forest]]. Firstly full of snags, but later on it turns into a swomp-ish / overgrown one. In these parts you would probably find a small monster in about every 2-3 meters and bigger one every ~100 meters. Now to the weird part. The minute you get closer to the forest, grey mist will surround you at all times. The sky will turn dark and the moons, which you could see only in the night, are perfectly visible in a reddish color.
After some time you could came across abandoned villages, which have found itself few hundreds of years back. Like frozen in time. After that, you would be walking on plains, plains, plains and plains... But on the very south part of the Shiva Island you will find few mansions and colossal castle, [[The tower of Rekku]]. But by now, without the proper visit/entrance, you would have been killed many, many times now. Or tortured, if you were unlucky.

## History
Shiva islands are one of the outcasts from the factions, as the sanctuary for vampires and one of the entrances to the [[Casted continent]].
