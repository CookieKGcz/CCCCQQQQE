11 moons orbit the Roann:
[[Kiruf]], [[Ala]], [[Anael]], [[Dardiel]], [[Seliel]], [[Liviel]], [[Xoniel]], [[Zupiel]], [[Alerog]], [[Anopo]], [[Oliruf]]

As they are now, they are aligned from the closest to farthest from land.

### [[Kiruf]]
The closest to the Roann, but also the smallest from the regulars. Size is about 668 km r. Has natural gray color. Takes 19 days to orbit.
### [[Ala]]
Double the size of Kiruf and little yellowish color. Size is about 1428 km r. Takes 27 days to orbit.
### [[Anael]]
First not round moon with a complex orbital path. Size is between xx (40 - 60 km r). Takes 738 days to orbit.
### [[Dardiel]] + [[Seliel]] + [[Liviel]]
Around Dardiel orbits other two moons (sub-moons) Seliel and Liviel. More info in their bio.
### [[Xoniel]] and [[Zupiel]]
First twin moons (take similar path). Blueish/Violet color. Similar sizes (900 - 1000 km r). Takes them 0.87 years to orbit.
### [[Alerog]] and [[Anopo]]
Second twin moons. Orangish color. Similar sizes (2300 - 2600 km r). Takes 1.22 years to orbit.
