Korion is :
"The space and reality the world of Roann is located in." (universe)


The word was introduced by the Masahabi astrologists from the [[Masahabi Institute]] in year 28 ASMGA[^1] at the end of the debate of the farthest orbiting object around the world of Roann, which was/were chosen as the moons [[Alerog]] and [[Anopo]]. As a new official terms had to be established, because of the cultural difference (which was quite annoying as there were a lot of words meaning the same thing), the word Korion was created.
