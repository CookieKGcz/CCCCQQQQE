Used in the [[Deep hole]] for climbing, rappelling and has survival-oriented accessories. The newer generation is powered by magic crystals.

## Ranks
The rank of the gear depends on what layer it is going to used on
- ### Rank 1 (1st l.)
	- Advanced equipment for climbing.
	- Has silenced rotors powered by magic crystals. 
	- The starting point of a descend (your anchor[^1]) is connected by a Silk thread[^1], which then is bounded to your soul, so when you die (the connection is lost with the starting point), your bolts, ropes and other things turn into mana if not bounded within 5 days.
	- Special breathing masks for high humidity, high temperature and high mana condensed environment.
	- Rank 1 equipment is mostly rented for about 200 gold a quarter of a year.
- ### Rank 2 (2nd - 3rd l.)
	- All things that are on rank 1.
	- With the third layer being quite hot, the breathing mask is enhanced, a medium artifact against heat is equipped and the gear is made of more resilient material.
	- This gear is most of the time bought (1000 - 1200 gold).
- ### Rank 3 (4th - 5th l.)
	- 
- ### Rank 4 (6st l.)
	- s
- ### Rank 5 (7th -  l.)
	- s


[^1] An anchor is the starting point of a descend and is created by hammering a pole from [[Asrof wood]] into the ground for about 10 meters. The "Silk thread"[^2] is then bound to it.

[^2] "Silk thread" is used for the ascend/return as it is on the path that you took down. Stored in a special pouch, it is condensed mana thread that is connected to other dimension, but is reflected in this one, so things can go through it.
The length depends on how much mana is condensed in the pouch.
