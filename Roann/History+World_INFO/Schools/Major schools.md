There are 11 major schools in [[Roann]].
- [[Elemental city of Echath]]
- [[Cieny]]
- [[Fymor Academy]]
- [[Batun School]]
- [[Naefore Academy]]
- [[Trirror Academy]]
- [[Iremorth Academy for Healing]]
- [[The Great Vofonia School]]
- [[Selia Institute]]
- [[Cliyne College]]
- [[Mornt Academy]]


As the number of students and practitioners is in the major schools highly above the standard, each having about 90'000 in dorms scholars, the scale of the Academies, Institutes or Schools has to be appropriate too. So you will probably find them as whole cities or massive constructs.

! Keep in mind !
The [[Headmasters]] are beings that reached where they are with their power, should it be knowledge, physical prowess or one of a kind talent for magic. It should be better to outright stay away from them! *XD*
