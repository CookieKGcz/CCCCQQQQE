## Laws
[[Roann]] in current year 1295:
- ### [[Ardees Mist Realm]]
	Aside from the Northern part like its capital [[Ardess]] or the area around the Major school the [[Selia Institute]], laws are not the most important thing. East part still has functional enforcement/police, but in almost every town there is some illegal activity going on. Around the [[Aryss town]] and the lake more of a banned wizardry is happening (Hags, and such). The last town, which has normal communication with the capital, travel that isn't life-threatening more then once a day and police still has some jurisdiction is [[Lilyn]]. If you move into the [[Rhesa Woodland]] and other western part of AMR, nobody will expect you to return.
- ### [[Gunlags Dominion of Dark Omen]]
	As the main trait of the GDoDO people, "Strength and will above all", there really aren't any laws which are set, but more unspoken rules to abide. The only exception is the [[Mornt Academy]] and (some northern cities), due to the fact that there is quite a number of non-native people residing there.
- ### [[Haford Empire]]
	Norther part is something like "for the people by the people" and little to no enforcement is needed. There are black spots, where monsters are running free, but the traveling routes are often guarded at some points, so unless u go off course u should be relatively fine (from the monster part). In the villages, if you won't start braking things or killing people, nobody will even remember you were there. The southern part, as it is a research haven, obviously invested in formidable protection. In this part u will find the most dangerous danger the people, as small cartels are present. More specifically, section between [[Dor]] and the [[Batun Towers]] is fucked with drug dealing and humanoid black market.
	And as mentioned the [[Batun Towers]] and [[Batun School]] are the exact opposite. U could say that for a normal citizen this is the safest place u could be at. Also as the students come from various continents, the security on the sea is also very high.
