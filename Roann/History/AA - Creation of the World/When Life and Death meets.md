>...
>And as something clicked for the first time
>and the ... inhaled deeply,
>some say because of boredom, others of appeal and sublime,
>it torn part of their soul out completely,
>.
>and after few moments,
>the birth of two concepts,
>who brought light and darkness into the seamlessly endless void,
>was the first instant, where joy and sadness,
>were but the same allopolyploid.
