## Geography
The surrounding isles are populated to the minimum, because of the raging [[Thisos sea]] and really the main core is the main Island.

All you can pretty much find are normal villages or some bigger towns (like 5000 to 10000 population).

The minute you get closer to the forest, grey mist will surround you at all times. The sky will turn dark and the moons, which you could see only in the night, are perfectly visible in a reddish color.
