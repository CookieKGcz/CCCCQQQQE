## Appearance: 
From the first moment the [[xx]] found her, she always had here pristine white hair, which in contrast to its shininess, she would dirtied it rather quickly. Just like a Hel from a Norse mythology, one half of her face is beautiful and the other not so. The left (from our perspective right) side of her has been burned when she was still a child. The tissue got distorted and her left eye, specifically the Iris, got severely damaged. If not for [[XX]], she probably wouldn't see on that eye at all. Not only the face got damaged, but her left arm was even in worse condition. The [[XX]] had make a semi-prosthesis, which allowed her to restore her arms functionality.
In the case of outfits, she really likes the [[Tyne]]'s family's hunter coat and vest with a banquets shirt underneath.

# Background
/: Tragedy, finding her (prob. in the woods if they are named after her), life in the family -> learning the family technique/swordsmanship/manners. Being recruited (of her own decision) into royal guards -> adventuring for xx years as the final test (prob could take a diff test, but choose *exploration and adventuring* because cringy ass shit mind) :/
